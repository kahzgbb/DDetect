# DDetect
Minecraft Doomsday Detector 1.8.9 - 1.21

## How this works?
The program makes a dump of the javaw process with a minimum length of 4 and a maximum of 30 to greatly optimize the search process, and if the Doomsday string is found in the process it prints a flag and if it is not found it prints that no trace was found.
**Must be running Minecraft**
